# TOKEN CONTRACT

This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of creating, minting, and burning tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how to create and manage a token.

## DESCRIPTION

This program is a token contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes functionalities to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and track the balance of tokens held by different addresses. This program serves as a foundational introduction to token creation and management in Solidity, and can be expanded upon for more complex token projects in the future.
